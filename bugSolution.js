The solution depends on the exact error message. Common approaches include:

1. **Update Expo CLI:** Run `npm install -g expo-cli` to ensure you have the latest version.
2. **Check `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`:** Verify that the Gradle version specified here is compatible with your project's dependencies. You might need to consult the Android Gradle Plugin Release Notes to find a compatible version.  Experiment with different Gradle versions.
3. **Inspect `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle`:** Look for conflicting dependencies or plugin versions. Try updating or removing conflicting entries. 
4. **Clean and rebuild:** Sometimes, a simple `expo prebuild` followed by `expo build:android --clean` will solve the problem. 
5. **Consult the Error Message:**  The error message itself may give clues about which dependency or version is causing the issue.  Search online for the specific error message to find potential solutions.

Example of modifying `gradle-wrapper.properties`:
```
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.6-all.zip
```
(Replace `gradle-7.6-all.zip` with a compatible version)

If none of these work, provide the complete error message in a Github issue to get more tailored assistance.
